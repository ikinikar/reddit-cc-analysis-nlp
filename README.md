Climate Change Reddit Posts NLP Analysis Project

In the Google Colab notebook CC_Reddit_Exploration_v1.ipynb, I will be analyzing a Reddit Climate Change Posts Dataset (Public Opinion on Climate Change).

Climate change is an issue that I deeply care about and I often find discourse around the subject to be fascinating and under-investigated. Online discourse tends to provide a unique lens, as many will say things online that they would never say in-person. Consequently, there tends to be a larger degree of polarization in some areas online than in others. Upon finding this dataset, I asked myself five questions that I wanted to answer:

1. Is climate change generally a polarizing topic on Reddit?
2. Are people generally optimistic about our chances at fighting or adjusting to climate change?
3. What types of topics do people commonly connect to climate change on Reddit?
4. Are the post scores (upvotes - downvotes) strongly dependent on the topic and the sentiment expressed by the post?
5. How much variation exists within Reddit discourse around climate change?


Plan

To find out the answers to my questions, I decided to analyze the dataset in four specific ways.

1. Look at overall sentiment in posts and find out whether people on Reddit associated positive, negative, or neutral sentiments with climate change broadly.
2. Find out the main topics that are commonly discussed in the posts of the dataset and find out how much of the overall discourse each constitutes.
3. Conduct statistical analysis to find out whether the post scores are correlated with the topic and sentiment of a post.
4. Conduct clustering analysis to understand how cleanly the dataset falls into clusters based on topics, sentiments, and post scores.
